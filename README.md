Main purpose is to allow book clerk to access different information within the database. By adding new books, updating book information, deleting books from database and searching for specific books.
I have created a menu to allow the user to navigate to different parts of this program. 

* For example, if the user wants to add new book, they would input "1" and then answer all of the information necessary to be added to the database.
